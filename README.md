# Flood Risk Management using Satellite Image Segmentation and Geospatial Analysis

During this year, there has been massive floods in Kerala and Nagaland costing the precious lives of thousands of beings and causing colossal damage. The frequency of hydrological catastrophes has been on the rise since the last few years. The idea to manage the risks of flood and find better ways to save lives and prevent economic losses is explained in this workflow as follows :-

- **Predict** -  
    * The topography of the terrain of all the prone areas(near water bodies) will be analysed using Digital Elevation Models(DEM).
    * DEM is 2D/3D representation of a terrain's surface, created from terrain elevation data.
    * A flood inundation model will be used to identify areas that will be impacted due to overflow of a water body.
    * This will allow to set up alert stations and rescue forces base at optimum positions in the possible area of disaster in the case of calamity.
    * Due to the optimum position of base stations, a lot of lives can be saved and evacuation points can be created to span the particular areas.
